# puppet-essential-control-repo

This is a Puppet open-source control repository.

It was created for use with https://www.linkedin.com/learning/puppet-essential-training

The course is older and not all the steps work exactly.

The setup of r10k, for example, does not work following the steps included. I leveraged the YouTube video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO77GgC9u48 which covers Puppet 6.
